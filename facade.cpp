/*
	The Facade Pattern hides the complexities of the system by providing an interface 
	to the client from where the client can access the system on a unified interface. 
	Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. 
	For instance making one class method perform a complex process by calling several other classes.
